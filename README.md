## Some of many things that have not been done:

- ~~😱 Any loading states~~ Now there are some on the character modals (but not when changing pages or searching)
- ⚠️ Error handling
- ~~⚽ Request debouncing for the search bar~~
- 🧪 UI/Unit testing
- ♿ Any thought about accessibility
- 📕 Pagination buttons should be disabled if there is only one page, or you are on the first/last pages
- 🥍Search/Pagination don't stick to the top/bottom
- 🐘 Character modal can be janky when viewing on a small device with a lot of episodes
