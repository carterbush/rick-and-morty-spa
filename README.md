Some of many things that have not been done:

- 😱 Any loading states
- ⚠️ Error handling
- ⚽ Request debouncing for the search bar
- 🧪 UI/Unit testing
- ♿ Any thought about accessibility
- 🗏 Pagination buttons should be disabled if there is only one page, or you are on the first/last pages
- 🥍Search/Pagination don't stick to the top/bottom
